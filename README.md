## Solutions of some of CS50 assignments
> CS50 is Harvard University's introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming.

This is my first time taking a course related to programming. In this repository, I will post some of my solutions to the labs and problem sets of CS50. I'm a beginner, so the codes here are probably not the best :sweat_smile:

This repository is for learning purposes only.
